Concepts:
* Image: An executable package containing all of the software that’s needed to run a container.
* Dockerfile: A file that defines a series of directives and is used to build an image.
* Docker Registry: A central location for storing and distributing images.
* Docker Hub: The default, public registry that’s operated by Docker.
* Service: A collection of one or more replica containers running the same image in a swarm.
* Task: A replica container that is running as part of a service.

There are two different types of data mounts on Docker:
* Bind Mount: Mounts a specific directory on the host to the container. It is useful for sharing configuration files, plus other data between the container and host.
* Named Volume: Mounts a directory to the container, but Docker controls the location of the volume on disk dynamically.
