Building a Docker Application Stack

Excercvise
Fruit Service
Provides a list of fruits sold in the company's stores.
You can use the Docker image tag linuxacademycontent/fruit-service:1.0.1 to run this service.
Listens on port 80.
The service should be named fruit inside the stack.
Vegetable Service
Provides a list of vegetables sold in the company's stores.
You can use the Docker image tag linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 to run this service.
Listens on port 80.
The service should be named vegetables inside the stack.
All Products Service
Queries the other two services, combining their data into a single list of all produce.
You can use the Docker image tag linuxacademycontent/all-products:1.0.0 to run this service.
Listens on port 80.
Use the environment variables FRUIT_HOST and FRUIT_PORT to set the host and port which will be used to query the fruit service.
Use the environment variables VEGETABLE_HOST and VEGETABLE_PORT to set the host and port which will be used to query the vegetable service.




Build and deploy the application stack.

#####Create an empty project directory with a Docker compose YAML file inside.

cd ~/
mkdir produce
cd produce
vi produce.yml
Build a stack definition in produce.yml to meet the provided specifications.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: '3'
services:
  fruit:
    image: linuxacademycontent/fruit-service:1.0.1
  vegetables:
    image: linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0
  all_products:
    image: linuxacademycontent/all-products:1.0.0
    ports:
    - "8080:80"
    environment:
    - FRUIT_HOST=fruit
    - FRUIT_PORT=80
    - VEGETABLE_HOST=vegetables
    - VEGETABLE_PORT=80

##### Deploy the stack using the compose file.

Creating network produce_default
Creating service produce_fruit

Scale the Fruit and Vegetable services in the stack.
##### Set the number of replicas to 3 for the Fruit and Vegetable services in the compose file.

vi produce.yml
version: '3'
services:
  fruit:
    image: linuxacademycontent/fruit-service:1.0.1
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
  vegetables:
    image: linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
  all_products:
    image: linuxacademycontent/all-products:1.0.0
    ports:
    - "8080:80"
    environment:
    - FRUIT_HOST=fruit
    - FRUIT_PORT=80
    - VEGETABLE_HOST=vegetables
    - VEGETABLE_PORT=80


##### Redeploy the stack using the compose file.
